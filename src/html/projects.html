<p> <i>â€œFusionFall RE:SPAWN is an unofficially fan-produced, non-profit remake of the 2009 title Cartoon Network
    Universe: FusionFall, loosely inspired by the fangame FusionFall Legacy. In this title, we hope to bring the
    game's original concept into fruition using every trick in the book, elevating the story and gameplay for a new,
    more advanced generation of animation fans. From '90s kids to '20s kids, even to the kids at heart, we aim to
    put out a product that appeals to this game's resilient community first and foremost. We promise to use our game
    as a platform for inclusivity, diversity, quality, and tons of fun through new gameplay styles and franchises to
    explore."</i></p>

<p>FusionFall Re:Spawn was cancelled in December of 2021. It was using the Unity's game engine like the original. I
joined the development team in hope of creating something that people will be able to enjoy as much as I enjoyed
playing the original game as a kid back in 2012-2013.</p>

<p>I worked on multiple scripts for FusionFall Re:Spawn such as the main menu scripts and the player camera and
movement scripts, while also helping others on the team by providing informational resources from Unity's scripting
documentation.</p>

    <h2>Discord TV</h2>
</a>
<p>There is no Discord app for Android TV so I decided to make my own worked out the QR authentication process by
    looking at the minified javascript from the desktop client and ported the code over to kotlin and implemented it
    into the app, before realizing the app would be breaking Discord's ToS and missing functionality available only to
    users with no information in Discord's documentation so I ended up quitting.</p>
