<h1>Who is Sopy?</h1>
<p>I love technology and talking about it, whether it will be a new line-up of mobile SoCs, some update to the DE
    (Desktop Environment) I use or me swapping to a new ROM for on my main phone there's always something new to
    talk about learn or be taught by others. I'd like to think of myself as a smart and nice individual but
    that's ultimately for the surrounding people to decide for themselves.</p>

<h1>What's my dream?</h1>
<p>Gaming has always been in a way an integral part of who I was, from when I was a child playing Super Mario
    on the SNES to nowadays. While my taste in games has definitely changed since then, it led to my passion for
    computers, experimenting with things and breaking the boundaries to see what I can find. Gaming also helped me
    learn English, and with that, learn all sorts of other things. My dream is to make games, and through that, give
    people the same opportunities I feel I've been given over the years, such as the opportunity to learn or
    exercise a new language, think outside the box and find creative ways to break the games and play them as they
    want... or just... well... have plain old fun.</p>

<h1>Why would you chose to hire me?</h1>
<p>Despite me still being in high school and studying tourism. I have the desire to learn and gain experience in the
    field of computer science as my personal projects might suggest.</p>
