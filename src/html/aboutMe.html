    <h1>Who is Sopy?</h1>
    <p>I love technology and talking about it, whether it will be a new line-up of mobile SoCs, some update to the DE
        (Desktop Environment) I use or me swapping to a new ROM for my phone there's always something new to be taught
        or teach to others. I'd like to think of myself as a smart and nice individual but that's ultimately on people
        around me to agree or not with how I see myself.</p>

    <h1>What's my dream?</h1>
    <p>Gaming has always been in a way an integral part of who I was, from when I was a small child playing Super Mario
        on the SNES to nowadays. While my taste in games has definitely changed since then, it led to my passion for
        computers, experimenting with things and breaking the boundaries to see what I can find. Gaming also helped me
        learn English and with that learn all sorts of other things. My dream is to make games and through that give
        people the same opportunities I feel I've been given over the years, such as, the opportunity to learn or
        exercise a new language, think outside the box and find creative ways to break the games and play them as they
        want... or just... well... have plain old fun.</p>

    <h1>Why would you chose to hire me?</h1>
    <p>Despite me being still in highschool and studying tourism. I have the desire to learn and gain experience in the
        field of computer science as my personal projects might suggest. Being so young also means I can catch onto new
        things happening in the tech space faster with my brain still being in development.</p>
